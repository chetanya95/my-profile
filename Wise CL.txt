Dear Sir/Mam,

I got to know about Wise from a friend & I was impressed by its mission: "Money without borders". I have a background in Financial space as I'm working in Amazon India Payments org & I believe there is a lot of potential here on which we can innovate upon.

Hence, I am applying for the role of "Senior Backend Engineer â€“ Finance & Treasury Tribe" at your esteemed organization. I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss my application at an interview. I can be contacted at all times regarding any details of my application.

Thanks & Regards,
Chetanya Goyal

I want to move in a mid-size startup where I can innovate & work on more impacting opportunities in the Financial space.
