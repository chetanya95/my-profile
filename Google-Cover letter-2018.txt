Dear Google,

I am always inspired with the products and services that you build, and genuinely want to fulfill my dream of life to do something great for the people through technological innovations and development.
I believe that I will be able to achieve this dream if I get an opportunity to work with you as an Android Developer.

Although I am having work experience of around 1.5 years with Corporate Organizations, but I am having experience with Android development of more than 3 years as I have been learning and developing Apps since the start of 2nd year of my undergrad college, i.e. mid 2014.
I have ideated and developed various Android apps which would benefit the people and I even got an opportunity to develop a full-fledged corporate Android App from scratch for FreeStand Sampling Solutions Pvt. Ltd.

I always try to create an App which would bring happiness to the User through both its very top UI and its functionality. To make an awesome UI, I designed and coded my own animations for FreeStand Android App which can't be found in any other mobile application. I even learned Sketch 4 and developed UI Designs for a Voice Assistant Android App, the design images for which can be found in my enclosed CV.

I believe I am highly suitable for the role of Software Engineer, Android at your organization and will fulfill mine and I believe your purpose of doing something great for the people. I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss my application at an interview. I have enclosed a copy of my CV for your consideration. I can be contacted at all times regarding any details of my application.

Thanks and Regards,
Chetanya Goyal
