Dear Sir/Mam,

I was very impressed with the technological innovations happening at Box. I'm having 5+ years of work experience & is currently working in Amazon as a Software Development Engineer 2. I was interested in the role of "Senior Backend Software Engineer " at your esteemed organization.

I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss my application at an interview. I can be contacted at all times regarding any details of my application.

Thanks & Regards,
Chetanya Goyal
