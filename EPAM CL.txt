Dear Sir/Mam,

I got to know about EPAM Systems from a friend & was impressed with the technolgical innovations happening in your organisation. I'm having 5+ years of work experience & is currently working in Amazon as a Software Development Engineer 2. I was interested in the role of "Lead Java Developer" at your esteemed organization.

I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss my application at an interview. I can be contacted at all times regarding any details of my application.

Thanks & Regards,
Chetanya Goyal
